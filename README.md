## üöÄ Core Features

City-Zen is built around three core pillars to encourage sustainable living:

#### comunidade Community Engagement

- **Social Feed:** Users can create posts, share updates, and interact with others through likes and comments.
- **Environmental Reporting:** Citizens can report local environmental issues like pollution or waste, which can be verified and liked by the community.
- **User Profiles & Following:** Build a network by following other users and tracking their progress.

#### üéÆ Gamification & Rewards

- **Points & Levels:** Earn points for eco-friendly actions like creating posts, reporting issues, and reducing utility consumption.
- **Badges & Achievements:** Unlock badges for completing specific tasks and reaching milestones.
- **Leaderboards:** Compete with friends and the global community based on points, level, or carbon savings.

#### üìä Utility & Carbon Tracking

- **Bill Management:** Manually log electricity, water, and gas bills to track consumption over time.
- **Carbon Footprint Calculation:** The app automatically calculates the CO‚ÇÇ savings based on reduced consumption, providing tangible feedback on your impact.
- **Usage Analytics:** Visualize your consumption trends and get insights into your resource usage patterns.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the City-Zen backend running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **MongoDB** installed and running on its default port (`27017`).
- **pip** (Python package installer).

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/city-zen-backend.git](https://github.com/your-username/city-zen-backend.git)
    cd city-zen-backend/backend
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection URI.

    ```env
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/city_zen
    JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key # Change this to a random string
    ```

5.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

### Frontend Usage

A temporary `index.html` file is provided to test all backend features. Simply open this file in your web browser to interact with the running backend.

## üîå API Endpoints

The API is organized into several blueprints. All endpoints require a JWT Bearer token in the `Authorization` header unless otherwise specified.
